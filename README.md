An autoregression (AR) model has been built on dataset consists details about new COVID-19 cases recorded in India on daily basis starting from 30th-Jan-2020 to 2-Oct-2021, which estimates the COVID-19 cases as a linear combination of given lagged data values and also the heuristic value for the optimal number of lags up to the condition on autocorrelation such that abs(AutoCorrelation) > 2/sqrt(T), where T is the number of observations in training set is found
