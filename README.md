# Covid19_Prediction
a dataset containing details about new COVID-19 cases recorded in India on daily
basis as a csv file (daily_covid_cases.csv). It shows the rolling 7-day average of newly
confirmed cases starting from 30th-Jan-2020 to 2-Oct-2021. Rows are indexed with dates; the first
column represents the date and the second column represents the new COVID-19 cases recorded
that day. We will use this dataset to build an autoregression (AR) model.
